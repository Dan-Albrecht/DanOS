# ToDo

 [x] Output to serial port so we can have more than a screen of data
 [ ] Stop hardcoding magic constants including the SATA drive
 [ ] Figure out why we cannot sometimes debug main.rs
 [ ] Serial shouldn't wait forever to init which causes hang
 [ ] Clean up hack city memory managment code
 [ ] Read from disk so we can hopefully have faster iteration loop and local storage
 [ ] Change resolution
 [ ] Get rid of all BUGBUGs
